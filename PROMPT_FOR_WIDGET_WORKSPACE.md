**Task: Set up GitHub repository and connect to Vercel for Deploy Hooks**

I need to connect the `uplinq-chat-widget` project to a GitHub repository so I can create Vercel Deploy Hooks. Currently, the Vercel project shows "This Project is not connected to a Git repository."

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new GitHub repository (or use existing if you have one)
   - Repository name: `uplinq-chat-widget` (or similar)
   - Make it private or public (your choice)
   - Initialize with README if needed

2. Connect the local widget project to the GitHub repository:
   - Add the GitHub remote
   - Push all current code to the repository
   - Ensure main/master branch is set up

3. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel:
   - Go to Vercel project settings: https://vercel.com/waynedevs-projects/uplinq-chat-widget/settings/git
   - Connect the GitHub repository
   - Select the correct branch (main/master)

4. After connection, provide:
   - The GitHub repository URL
   - Confirmation that it's connected in Vercel

**Current Vercel Project:**
- Project name: `uplinq-chat-widget`
- Team: `waynedevs-projects`
- Vercel URL: https://vercel.com/waynedevs-projects/uplinq-chat-widget

**Goal:** Once connected, I'll be able to create Deploy Hooks in Vercel to trigger deployments programmatically from my admin dashboard.
